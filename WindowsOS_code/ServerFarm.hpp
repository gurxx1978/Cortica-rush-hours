#include <set>			// Set data structure. Implements a binary tree
						// and supports in order insertion in O(log n) time.
						// A better choice would be std::unordered_set but that 
						// would require a hash function overload that supports std::tuples
						// which is the key. For our purposes this will still work
						// but ideally we would work around an unordered set 

#include <tuple>		// C++11 data structure that models an N-dimensional std::pair
						// Provides a n-tuple interface with n being a meta parameter
						// and elements are accessible via the std::get<i>(tuple) method,
						// where i is the ith element of the tuple

#include <iostream>		// Standard I/O etc.

#include <mutex>		// C++11 interface that provides mutual exclusion guards in case
						// of multi-threading. It's good to implement this mechanism in case
						// our server has async requests of high volume. See test3() for demo

#include <condition_variable>	// C++11 synchronization primitive that notifies waiting threads
								// that are currently locked out of the method. NotifyOne() method 
								// wakes up a single waiting thread of the waiting pool

#include <algorithm>	// Includes for_each(). Notice that for_each is valid until C++20. Then it will
						// be deprecated since an equivalent looping method is provided by 
						// the C++11 range-based loop

//*** ServerFarm class definition ***// 

// This class models a request/query interface for our server farm.
// Client computers can query the rush hour database to check whether or
// not a particular hour is considered rush hour.
// 
// * Data structure model: O(log n) insertion on average, O(n) worst case
// The rush hour database is modeled by an ordered binary tree (std::set) of 2-dimensional
// tuples and does not allow duplicates -- this is an attribute of an std::set. Thus, whenever
// we attempt to insert an existing tuple the STL data structure will prevent it for us internally.
// The limitation of std::set is that it does in-order insertion, which takes up to logarithmic
// time, when ideally we would like constant insertion time. As mentioned above, this can be 
// takcled by using a unordered set instead, in which case we would have to overload the 
// key hash method so it can hash std::tuples.
//
// * Query method: O(n) worst case
// The query method uses a range based for loop to iterate in all time span tuples
// and check if the queried time is in that range. Returns true or false accordingly.
// The query method might be called by multiple client computers, thus it is safer 
// to implement synchronization primitives and mutual exclusion mechanisms to make
// sure there is no confusion in the output. Additionally, we need to unlock the mutex
// in all cases before the function returns, otherwise we get deadlock. In case an 
// exception is thrown before we unlock, the std::unique_lock wrapper class will make
// sure to unlock the mutex as well, thus preventing a deadlock in all cases. Alternatively, 
// we would also have to unlock in the destructor.
//
// * Auxiliary print method
// I decided to add a print method as well for better testing and demo convenience.
// It simply prints all tuples in the database
